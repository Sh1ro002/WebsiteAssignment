for the colour scheme i used black and white just because it looks 
the cleanest in my opinion. gradient was done in the contact me form

used max width 480 for phone as is standard practice since anything below 480 = phone
used min width 481 max width 959 for tablets as is standard practice since between this 
number device is considered to have tablet dimensions
used min width 960 for laptop/desktop as is stanard practice because those dimensions and above are classified to be that
and no tablet would have that kind of resolution

code for button click effect was done with the help from this lesson: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp
